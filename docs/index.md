# Learn Unix Terminals

**The terminal can be overwhelming and it is difficult to know where to
start. Sometimes all it takes is a guide to walk you through the basics
to go further and learn things yourself. This course framework aims to
teach you shells, filesystems, and Unix tools that developers use every
day. Once you learn how this system works harmoniously, you will always
wonder how you lived without them.**
